        <h1 id="phrase">As soon as the moon appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds, the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer night; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and all was still. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another. The night was clear and cool, the sky a beautiful pageant of dark blue silk and brilliant stars, of streaking meteors and two glowing orbs.</h1>
